# 2FA Code Viewer

A Next.js web application that allows you to view 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) codes from secret keys.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Input form to enter your 2FA secret key
- **Dynamic Route**: `/2fa/show/{secretKey}` endpoint to display 2FA codes
- **Real-time Updates**: Codes automatically refresh every 30 seconds
- **Visual Countdown**: Progress bar showing time until next code refresh
- **Manual Refresh**: Button to manually refresh the current code
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to system theme preferences

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd 2fa-on-web
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

### Method 1: Web Interface
1. Visit the home page
2. Enter your 2FA secret key in the input field
3. Click "View 2FA Code" to see your current code

### Method 2: Direct URL
Navigate directly to `/2fa/show/{your-secret-key}` where `{your-secret-key}` is your actual 2FA secret key.

**Example**: `/2fa/show/JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`

## How It Works

The application uses the `otplib` library to generate TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) codes from your secret key. These codes are the same ones generated by authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator.

- **Code Generation**: Uses the TOTP algorithm with a 30-second time window
- **Automatic Refresh**: Codes update every 30 seconds to stay synchronized
- **Validation**: Invalid secret keys are detected and appropriate error messages are shown

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations**:

- This application runs entirely in your browser - no secret keys are sent to any server
- However, be cautious when using this on shared or public computers
- The secret key is visible in the URL and browser history
- Consider using this only on trusted devices
- Never share your secret keys with anyone

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **otplib**: TOTP/HOTP library for 2FA code generation
- **React Hooks**: State management and side effects

## Building for Production

```bash
